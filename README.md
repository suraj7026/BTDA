## Tumor Classification and Patient-Friendly Explanation with Deep Learning

Overview

Project Goal: This project integrates a deep learning model that accurately predicts tumor classes from MRI scans with the GEMMA text generation tool. The primary aim is to provide patients with clear, understandable explanations of their MRI results.
Accuracy: The deep learning model demonstrates an impressive accuracy of approximately 97%.
Model Architecture

Convolutional Layers: Extract meaningful features from MRI images.
4 Convolutional layers with 'relu' activation, increasing feature complexity.
MaxPooling layers progressively reduce image dimensionality.
Dense Layer: Classification layer with 512 units and 'relu' activation.
Dropout: Regularization technique (rate = 0.5) to prevent overfitting.
LSTM Layer: Adds capability to understand context within image data (128 units).
Output Layer: Dense layer with 'softmax' activation for multi-class tumor prediction.
